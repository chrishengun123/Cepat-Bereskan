		"Just outside the door, there was a woman carrying a small luggage, smiling at him.",
		"Mom : “Honey, I’m home”",
		"Without a moment wasted, the woman pulled him in a warm hug.",
		"But then she froze. Letting go the young man in her grasp, she saw dust all over her and the boy’s clothes.",
		"Mom : “Sweetie… why are your clothes covered in dust?”",
		"He froze. Cold sweet starts trailing off his forehead.",
		"Boy : “Well… it’s a long story…”",
		"The man stepped aside the door, letting her see the view of the house.",
		"Behind him was the disaster zone of a living room. Trash everywhere, weird sticky puddles, and piles of who-knows-what piled over the floor.",
		"His mom squinted.",
		"Mom : “Oh really ?”",
		"That day, sounds of misery and hysteria sounded across the neighborhood."
